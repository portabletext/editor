# Code style

- Avoid code comments unless they explain **why** a piece of code is needed
- Comments for an if statement go inside the if statement, not above it
- Place helper functions below main functions
- Only use type casting as a last resort
- Use backticks when referencing code in comments and other text
- Don't use one-character variable names
- Use full, easily-understood variable names
