The Portable Text Editor (PTE) is the officially supported editor for working with [Portable Text](https://github.com/portabletext/portabletext). Customize it to fit the needs of your authors and content team using a schema,

## Schema

The PTE accepts a schema that describes the kinds of content it can implement. This is used throughout the editor to configure parts of the interface and aspects of the Portable Text output.

{/* <!-- Add some note in here about how the PTE schema differs from a Sanity schema --> */}

A schema consists of styles, decorators, annotations, block objects, inline objects, and lists. Here is an example schema from the [getting started guide](/getting-started/):

```js
{
  decorators: [{name: 'strong'}, {name: 'em'}, {name: 'underline'}],
  annotations: [{name: 'link'}],
  styles: [
    {name: 'normal'},
    {name: 'h1'},
    {name: 'h2'},
    {name: 'h3'},
    {name: 'blockqoute'},
  ],
  lists: [{name: 'bullet'}, {name: 'number'}],
  inlineObjects: [{name: 'stock-ticker'}],
  blockObjects: [{name: 'image'}],
}
```

You'll likely see connections to the elements found in rich text editors, along with some extras.

### Styles

Styles are a way to identify text blocks in Portable Text and signal to the editor how to classify the block. They don't add any other data to the text. Examples include:

- Headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- Block quotes
- Normal paragraphs

Convention uses HTML naming for these styles, but it is not required and has no direct impact on the style of the content.

### Decorators

Decorators are inline text with added meaning. Examples include:

- Bold text
- Emphasis or italicized text
- Underlined text

Decorators are a type of [Portable Text mark](https://github.com/portabletext/portabletext?tab=readme-ov-file#markdefs-array).

### Annotations

Like decorators, annotations are inline text with added meaning. Annotations are more complex than decorators, and often include additional functionality. Examples include:

- Links
- References

Annotations are a type of [Portable Text mark](https://github.com/portabletext/portabletext?tab=readme-ov-file#markdefs-array).

### Lists

Lists are groups of text blocks. They take into account the position each block has in a group. Examples include:

- Bullet lists
- Numbered lists

### Block objects

Block objects sit alongside text. For example, an image block may sit between a heading and a paragraph. They can hold any kind of data. Some examples include:

- Images
- Code blocks
- Videos
- Portable Text editors

### Inline objects

Inline objects, much like block objects, can hold any kind of data. Instead of existing alongside text, inline objects exist inside text blocks. Examples include:

- Footnote indicators
- Non-text emoji substitutes

Inline objects differ from annotations and decorators because they aren't wrapping existing text. Instead, they are self contained.

## Rendering content in and out of the editor

The schema serves as a foundation for how the PTE renders the text. On it's own, passing just a schema to the editor only annotates or _describes_ text, but it won't change the way it renders.

To affect the way text renders in the editor, pass custom renderers to the editor.

To affect the way text renders once it's stored as Portable Text, use an existing serializer or write your own.

## The toolbar

A schema describes the type of content an author can create in the editor, but without a toolbar there's no way to assign the schema to each piece of text.

The toolbar allows you to define the graphical user interface for creating rich text in the PTE. The most common way to do this is by using the schema as a foundation.

## Behaviors

Behaviors change how users interact with the editor. They handle everything from direct text input, to changing paste behavior, to allowing you to write custom shortcuts.

The editor comes with many behaviors by default, but you can also create your own.
