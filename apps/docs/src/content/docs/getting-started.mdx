This guide leads the reader through installing and using common features of the portable text editor (PTE).

One paragraph intro of the PTE. Link to learn more about PT and the PTE ecosystem.

## Add the PTE to your project

Start by installing the editor to your project

<PackageManagers pkg="@portabletext/editor" />

## Define your schema

Before you can render the editor, you need a schema. The editor schema configures the types of content rendered by the editor.

We'll start with a schema that includes some common rich text elements.

```ts
const schemaDefinition = defineSchema({
  // Decorators are simple marks that don't hold any data
  decorators: [{name: 'strong'}, {name: 'em'}, {name: 'underline'}],
  // Annotations are more complex marks that can hold data
  annotations: [{name: 'link'}],
  // Styles apply to entire text blocks
  // There's always a 'normal' style that can be considered the paragraph style
  styles: [
    {name: 'normal'},
    {name: 'h1'},
    {name: 'h2'},
    {name: 'h3'},
    {name: 'blockqoute'},
  ],
  // Lists apply to entire text blocks as well
  lists: [{name: 'bullet'}, {name: 'number'}],
  // Inline objects hold arbitrary data that can be inserted into the text
  inlineObjects: [{name: 'stock-ticker'}],
  // Block objects hold arbitrary data that live side-by-side with text blocks
  blockObjects: [{name: 'image'}],
})
```
