Below are some common behavior examples. You can also find a list of core behaviors [on GitHub](https://github.com/portabletext/editor/tree/main/packages/editor/src/behaviors)

## Log inserted text

Send and `effect` type action along with an `effect` to perform side effects.

```js
const logInsertText = defineBehavior({
    on: 'insert.text',
    actions: [
      ({event}) => [
        {
          type: 'effect',
          effect: () => {
            console.log(event)
          },
        },
        event,
      ],
    ],
  }
```
