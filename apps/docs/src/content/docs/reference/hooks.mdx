## `useEditor`

Access the editor context. Commonly used when building toolbars or passing context to selectors.

```tsx
import {useEditor} from '@portabletext/editor'

const editor = useEditor()
```

## `useEditorSelector`

Access selectors in areas where the context is unavailable by combining with `useEditor`.

```tsx
import {useEditor, useEditorSelector} from '@portabletext/editor'
import * as selectors from '@portabletext/editor/selectors'

const editor = useEditor()
const isActive = useEditorSelector(editor, selectors.isActiveDecorator('em'))
```
