    And "o" is typed
    And "o" is typed
    And "o" is typed
    And "r" is typed by editor B
    And "r" is typed by editor B
    And "r" is typed by editor B
    Then the text is "fooooo|barrrr"
    When undo is performed
    Then the text is "foo|barrrr"
    When undo is performed by editor B
    Then the text is "foo|bar"

  # Currently fails

    And "Enter" is pressed by editor B
    And undo is performed

  @skip
  Scenario: Undoing local annotation added after remote annotation
    Given the text "foobar"

    When undo is performed
    Then the text is "foo,bar"
    And "foo" has no marks
    And "bar" has marks "l1"

  @skip
  Scenario: Undoing local same-type annotation added before remote annotation
    Given the text "foobar"
    And a "comment" "c1" around "foo"
    And a "comment" "c2" around "bar" by editor B
    When undo is performed
    Then the text is "foo,bar"
    And "foo" has no marks
    And "bar" has marks "c2"

  # Currently fails
  @skip
  Scenario: Undoing and redoing local annotation before remote annotation
    Given the text "foobar"
    And a "comment" "c1" around "foo"
    And a "comment" "c2" around "bar" by editor B
    When undo is performed
    Then the text is "foo,bar"
    And "foo" has no marks
    And "bar" has marks "c2"
    When redo is performed
    Then "foo" has marks "c1"
    And "bar" has marks "c2"
