      | ",{stock-ticker},foo" | after "foo" | "{Shift}"     | ",{stock-ticker},foo# new" |
      # This is an edge case we have to live with. There's no way of knowing
      # that the inline object before the caret should prevent the rule from
      # running.
      | ",{stock-ticker},f"   | after "f"   | "{Backspace}" | "new,{stock-ticker},"      |

      | "(coo\|bar" | "ooba"    | ")"           | "©newr"   |

  Scenario Outline: Undo after transform on expanded selection
