Feature: Ellipsis Input Rule

  Background:
    Given the editor is focused
    And a global keymap

  Scenario Outline: Inserting ellipsis in unformatted text
    Given the text <text>
    # The "When {string} is inserted" step inserts all characters at once to
    # mimic how insert.text behaves on Android
    When <inserted text> is inserted
    Then the text is <before undo>
    When undo is performed
    Then the text is <after undo>

    Examples:
      | text           | inserted text  | before undo        | after undo           |
      | ".."           | "."            | "…"                | "..."                |
      | ""             | "..."          | "…"                | "..."                |
      | "foo"          | "..."          | "foo…"             | "foo..."             |
      | ""             | "foo..."       | "foo…"             | "foo..."             |
      | "foo.."        | ".bar"         | "foo…bar"          | "foo...bar"          |
      | ""             | "foo...bar..." | "foo…bar…"         | "foo...bar..."       |
      | "foo...bar..." | "baz..."       | "foo...bar...baz…" | "foo...bar...baz..." |

  Scenario: Inserting ellipsis inside a decorator
    Given the text "foo.."
    And "strong" around "foo.."
    When the caret is put after "foo.."
    And "." is typed
    Then the text is "foo…"
    And "foo…" has marks "strong"

  Scenario: Inserting ellipsis at the edge of a decorator
    Given the text "foo.."
    And "strong" around "foo"
    When the caret is put after "foo.."

    And "." is typed
    Then the text is "foo,…"
    And "foo" has marks "l1"
    And "…" has no marks

  Scenario Outline: Smart undo with Backspace
    Given the text <text>
    When <inserted text> is inserted
    And "{Backspace}" is pressed
    Then the text is <new text>

    Examples:
      | text           | inserted text  | new text             |
      | ".."           | "."            | "..."                |

      | "foo.."        | ".bar"         | "foo...bar"          |
      | ""             | "foo...bar..." | "foo...bar..."       |
      | "foo...bar..." | "baz..."       | "foo...bar...baz..." |

  Scenario Outline: Smart undo aborted after text changes
    Given the text <text>
    When <inserted text> is inserted
    And <new text> is typed
